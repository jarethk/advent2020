Part 1 - this seems almost too simple.  Push cards to each player on input, for each round shift from each player, and whomever wins gets both cards pushed.  Even the tally is simple, reverse the winner, do a little map to multiply, and a quick reduction.

Part 2 - ah, now this is more interesting.  Each game is recursive, under the right circumstances.
